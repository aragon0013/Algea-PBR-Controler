# Algea PBR Controler
Software to Control an Algea PBR, this software was developed during a environmental project from university.

I'm not a professional programmer, I created this work with passion and I liked to work on this software. But I also like to learn and improve my programming skills, so if anybody wants to give me tips and improvements I'm open for discussions.
